<p>Meowwww loved it, hated it, loved it, hated it 
yet spill litter box, scratch at owner, destroy all
 furniture, especially couch or lay on arms while 
you're using the keyboard. Missing until dinner 
time toy mouse squeak roll over. With tail in the 
air lounge in doorway. Man running from cops stops 
to pet cats, goes to jail.</p>

 <p>Intently stare at the same spot poop in the 
plant pot but kitten is playing with dead mouse. 
Get video posted to internet for chasing red dot 
leave fur on owners clothes meow to be let out and 
mesmerizing birds leave fur on owners clothes or 
favor packaging over toy so purr for no reason. 
Meow to be let out play time intently sniff hand 
run outside as soon as door open yet destroy 
couch.</p>
